    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>
I am a senior computer science major at University of Illinios at Chicago (UIC). I am very interested in developing video games. I have played them all my life and recently developed my own video game for a class at UIC. The best experience about this class was that it was split between two schools, UIC and LSU. The class was broken down into teams of four.  Each team was required to make a fake company name and design a game for the rest of the semester. Each team had two people from each school. Generally three programmers and one artist. Of those four individuals, one of those people was the team leader. The class taught me how to work with people over long distance that I would never meet face to face. We arranged group meetings and pair programming sessions using skype.

  Once I started taking the video game design class, I realized what I wanted to do with my career in computer science. I spent all my free time and school time designing my video game. It was an odd feeling to find something I liked to do more than play video games, and that was designing them.

  In my final semester (fall 2010) I will be taking a graphics design course as well as independent study where I will create a new game using the Unity graphics engine.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
As mentioned above, I am interested in video games and video game design. Some of my favorite video games come from Blizzard Entertainment which includes the Starcraft series, Diablo series, and Warcraft III series (not World Of Warcraft). I am also a big fan of first person shooters such as the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and all of valve's games, especially Left 4 Dead 2.

      Besides Computers and all their excellence, I do have a few other interests. Those would include, pool, frisbee, soccer, kung fu, skiing, snowboarding, hockey, and swimming.
