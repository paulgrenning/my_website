      The image above shows the earthquake activity prior to the disaster that happened in 2010. There is practically
      no activity near Haiti. We do see a lot around Puerto Rico though, but the magnitude of their activity is pretty low.

        The image above shows the earthquake activity in Haiti during 2010. It may not look like much compared to Puerto Rico
        next to it with lots of data points, but Haiti's datapoints have a much higher magnitude. The magnitude of the points
        surrounding Puerto Rico are between 0-3.5 while Haiti's are between 3.5 and 5.5.

        You may notice some areas don't have activity in earlier years, this is just a hunch, but I think
        when you see datapoints arise in later years during the video, that means someone laid new siesometers
        in that area to start collecting data.

        The image above shows a very high magnitude earthquake in Turkey in 1999. Using the earthquake visualization tool
        and setting the year to 1999 and the magnitude to 6.5 you will see 1 dot. Wikipedia claims the earthquake was as high as
        7.9.

        The image above shows Turkey in 1999. There are still a number of points around the area but no where near as many as

        The image above shows Tangshan, China in 1976 when a massive earthquake hit known as the "Great Tangshan Earthquake". It is believed to 
        have the largest death toll as far as earthquakes go in the 20th century.

        The image above shows Tangshan, China after the earthquake in 1977 that killed 255,000 people. As you can see the activity
        dropped severly after the earthquake. Everything seems to have settled.
