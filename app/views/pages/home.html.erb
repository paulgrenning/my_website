      I am originally from the north west suburbs of Chicago. I currently reside in Chicago,
      where I attend UIC. My previous job was at Obitva where
      I had the privelege to be taught Ruby and Ruby On Rails for a summer. I also worked 
      as an intern/coop at Zebra Technologies over a period of two and a
      half years. Previously in doubt about my future in the field, my internship with 
      Zebra taught me that computer science was the correct career for me.

      I am a graduate student working for my masters in Computer Science at UIC.
      I am currently doing research at the Electronic Visualization Research Lab.
      I am very interested in developing video games. I have played them all my life, and I have
      recently developed my own video game for a class at UIC. The class was split between two schools, UIC and LSU,
      and students were grouped into teams of four. Each team consisted of two people from each
      school, generally three programmers and one artist. Of those four individuals, one
      was selected as the team leader. Nominated as my team's leader, each team was required to invent a company name
      and design a game for the rest of the semester. As we had arranged our group meetings and pair
      programming sessions using Skype, the class taught me how to work with people over
      long distance that I would never meet face to face. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As the video game design class progressed, I realized what I wanted to do
      with my career in computer science, and I spent all my free time and school time designing
      my video game. It was an odd feeling to find something I liked to do more than play
      video games: design them myself.
      </p>
      <p>
      As for my recent work with video game development, I have made a number of small games with 
      the Unity3d game engine. Since I am creating these games by myself that means I must create my
      own models. So I have been teaching myself Autodesk 3ds Max.

      Some of
      my favorite video games come from Blizzard Entertainment, including the Starcraft series,
      the Diablo series, and the Warcraft III series (excluding World Of Warcraft, however). Other similar games
      include Titan Quest series and Torchlight. I am also a big fan of first 
      person shooters such as the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and many of Valve's games, especially Left 4 Dead 2.
      </p>
      <p>
      I also build my own computers. So far I am at two full computers, but over the years, as a video game
      fanatic, I have had to swap out many parts to make sure my machine was always running perfectly.
      This hardware has included graphics cards, as I always wanted the best graphics technology (which I sadly learned was not
      always worth the money).  
      </p>
      <p>
      Besides computers and all their excellence, I do have a few other interests, which would include, pool, 
      Frisbee, soccer, kung-fu, snowboarding, hockey, and swimming.
