              My 2010 summer internship was spent at Obtiva in downtown Chicago.
              This is the first website I have ever created, and I had the privelage of
              being able to design my own website with the help of many Obtivians. I have
              furthered my web development skill by constantly changing my current sites design 
              as well as developing jamesgrenning.com. As part of my the UIC medical campus, I have also
              developed a C# asp.net web portal.

            <p>
            During the development of these sites, I have done custom html, css, and javascript. Along with that
            I have familiarized myself with the JQuery library, SQL databases, and Active Record databases.
